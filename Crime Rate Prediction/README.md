Crime Rate Prediction | Python (Scikit-learn, XGBoost) 

• Analyzed 2000 socio-economic and law enforcement records in the USA (1990). 

• Performed data cleaning and feature engineering, identified key factors of crime rates (% of children 
born out of wedlock; % of two-parent families; % of White population). 

• Trained models: RandomForest (R² = 0.62, MAE = 235) and XGBRegressor (R² = 0.64, MAE = 213). 

• Results can help identify high-risk areas for preventive measures.
